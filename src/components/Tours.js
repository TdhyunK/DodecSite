				Every December, after the Thanksgiving holiday, the Dodecs go on a national or 
				international tour to perform for alumni clubs and other organizations, do a cappella 
				workshops with middle and high schools, donate time and talent to charities, and reach
				out to various other groups. These tours give the group the opportunity to sight-see, 
				meet Dartmouth alumni, and strengthen group bonds outside of Hanover. 

				In the recent past, the Dodecs have traveled to Boston, California, Florida, and Texas.
				Last year's tour managers, Emily Levine and Malcolm Joung, put together a fantastic Dodec
				tour through New England, and our new tour managers Ben Coleman and Matt Spencer are 
				looking forward to planning another successful tour! If you have any suggestions for 
				possible tour locations, venues, or activities, please contact 
				us (hyperlink to contact page) with your ideas.
