				<h3> A score and a half ago (in 1984), twelve people got together and said, 
				"Ya know what we need? More music, less background." Hence, the Dodecaphonics were born.
				The Dartmouth Dodecaphonics are the College's oldest and premier co-ed a cappella group. 
				Affectionately called "The Dodecs," we sing music of all types - - 80's, rock, contemporary pop,
				face-melting ballads, Dartmouth traditionals, etc. We are an extremely diverse group of 
				students bringing with us an incredible variety of interests, talents, abilities and 
				strengths. Our majors span the curriculum, our hometowns span the country, and our heights
				span quite a few inches, too. 
				Some additional facts about the Dodecs: We were the first a cappella group at Dartmouth
				to be recognized on Best of College A Cappella, a nationally-recognized compilation CD. 
				We have opened for Bobby McFerrin, been a featured performing group at Disneyworld in 
				Orlando, and toured throughout the world. We have been at least ICCA semifinalists every 
				time we've competed in the competition. We have sung in Lincoln Center to honor our now 
				past-president and first lady, Jim and Susan Wright. We were invited by former President 
				Kim to travel to San Francisco to perform at an event celebrating the completion of the 
				Campaign for the Dartmouth Experience (a $1.3 Billion fundraising campaign) and to meet 
				and mingle with alumni. We were even chosen as the opener for the 2008 MSNBC-televised 
				Democratic Presidential Primary Debate and the 2012 Bloomberg Republican Presidential 
				Primary Debate at Dartmouth, where we were lauded for our warm sound (and our good looks). </h3>
